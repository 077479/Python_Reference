# 1 Basics
- link to a list of patterns: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog
- design patterns are the idea of bringing well working engineering designs into software developing (like house construction, there are well engineered designs for windows that the architect can choose from without concerning himself with engineering a new one where everything has to be calculated from the beginning)
- a design pattern solves a specific common software problem
- a design pattern is a suggestion for an ideal solution in terms of object oriented designs
- BUT just use one design pattern after another does not guarantee the best solution
- e.g. in 1907 the quebec bridge collapsed while under construction because the architects underestimated the mass of the construction itself and choose to merge and adapt one design pattern after another, which lead to the collapse
- so the job is to recognize the specifics of a problem and adapt a fitting design pattern
- design patterns are distinguishe into several categories like
    1. Behavioral Patterns
        - these patterns are design blueprints for the interaction of objects
		- many of them are helping to make code look cleaner and remove redundancies
    2. Creational Patterns
        - for creation of objects
    3. Structural Patterns
        - blueprints that help to assemble different objects into a larger structure
