# Python Reference by 077479

# Basic
- this repository represents a by me created "reference for python" for my personal useage
- this collection of knowledge was created over several months from several books and other sources
- the order seen here reflects a personal choice of me to order the specific topics
- this means that a difference in knowledge will be reflected in the different parts that must not match with the order of the folders
- i.e. "Part-III" is much more advanced as "Part-IV"
- i will eventually update the different parts with new gained knowledge but this is not my topmost priority
- if i have something incorrect or i miss something feel free to contact me
- at last you can keep every grammar and or spelling error that you find
