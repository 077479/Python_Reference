# Basics
- verifies that a product is fit for purpose
- adresses more a responsibility issue
- stresses a specific workflow which is expected by the system

# Example Real World
- aircraft acceptance test
    - a buisness scenario leads to the expected result in an almost real stuation => boarding with test passengers to check that staff can monitor the boarding as expected with the operating procedures. some scenatrios could be that simple that it could look like a unit test, but is performed by the user
    - the system works in an almost buisness situation => make an empty test flight between two real destinations to check that the fuel consumption is as expected
